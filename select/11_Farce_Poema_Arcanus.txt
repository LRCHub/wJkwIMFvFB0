Tired to hear the same lies
Tired to look the same smile faces
Tired to look the electoral show
Disconnect de TV think for a minute

They wanna make me think - in dying for the flag
They wanna meke me feel - as a part of the machine
They wanna meke me lie - praying to their god
Listen to your mind and ignore the fucken farce

Chorus
Hypnotized - prejudice
Leave the mass - farce

Ignore the fucken farce!

Fucken liars, drive the nation
While poorness go from bad to worse
Politicians only talk to much
But these motherfuckers, nothing do

Chorus
